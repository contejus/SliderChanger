# SliderChanger

This repo contains the source code for the SliderChanger tweak, built by following jontelang's tutorial, found [here](http://jontelang.com/guide/chapter3/the-project.html).  

While jontelang's tutorial is a bit outdated in terms of the classes being hooked, I have updated the code to work on an iPhone 6 on iOS 12.4. All other versions or devices are untested. 

There is a slight delay in propagating the updated value to the lockscreen, please wait for the lockscreen string to be updated.
